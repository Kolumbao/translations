  explanation:
    text: '**Here''s a quick explanation:**


      - This is a bot that allows you to talk to others without being in the same
      server as them.

      - These "bots" aren''t bots, they''re other people from other guilds.

      - Kolumbao uses a bit of magic called "webhooks" to share your messages across
      servers.

      - After their names, certain people have emojis, these all mean different things.'
