# Translations
This is the translations repository for Kolumbao.

## Adding translations
All translations are listed in `.YAML` (YAML Ain't Markup Language) files, and [the English file](https://github.com/Kolumbao/translations/blob/master/en.yaml) should be considered the primary file.

Please ensure that your files are correctly formatted before making a pull request - they will be checked before being added however.

All the files should match up to the primary file, and as many keys should be present as possible. The bot automatically picks English in place of the chosen language if no translation is found.
